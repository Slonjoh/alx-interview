# Rotate 2D Matrix

This repository contains a Python script to rotate an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

## Description

The `rotate_2d_matrix.py` script provides a function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` that takes a 2D matrix as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation is performed in-place, meaning the original matrix is modified directly.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Slonjoh/alx-interview.git
	```
3. Navigate to the `0x07-rotate_2d_matrix` directory:
	```bash
	cd alx-interview/0x07-rotate_2d_matrix
	```

4. Modify the matrix variable in `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py` with your desired matrix.

5. Run the script:
	```bash
	./0-rotate_2d_matrix.py
	```

## Example
Given the matrix:
	```bash
	[[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9]]
	```
After rotation, the matrix becomes:
	```bash
	[[7, 4, 1],
	[8, 5, 2],
	[9, 6, 3]]
	```
